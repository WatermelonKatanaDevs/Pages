# 🍉 WatermelonKatana Pages 🗡️

Pssst...! I'm a secret repository! 🤫 In all seriousness, this is the public work on WatermelonKatana's pages.

## 🚀 What’s Happening Here?

- **CSS to SASS Migration**: We're in the process of migrating from CSS to SASS for better maintainability and scalability. It's a big change, and we’re excited to see where this takes us!

- **HTML to Handlebars Migration**: We're also migrating from HTML to Handlebars to make our pages more dynamic and easier to manage. This will help us create a more consistent experience across the site.

- **New Features**: We’re always looking for ways to improve our pages and make them more user-friendly. If you have any ideas or suggestions, we’d love to hear them!

- **Open for Contributions**: If you want to help out, feel free to jump in! Whether it's fixing bugs, suggesting new features, or just playing around with the code, we’d love to have your contributions.
