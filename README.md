# 🍉 WatermelonKatana Pages 🗡️

Pssst...! I'm a secret repository! 🤫

In all seriousness, this is the public work on WatermelonKatana's pages. WatermelonKatana is going to be moving from CSS to SASS, and this is the repository where all the work is going to be done. The repository is public so that anyone can see the work that is being done, and so that anyone can contribute to the project.

## 🚀 What’s Happening Here?

- **CSS to SASS Migration**: We're in the process of migrating from CSS to SASS for better maintainability and scalability. It's a big change, and we’re excited to see where this takes us!

- **Open for Contributions**: If you want to help out, feel free to jump in! Whether it's fixing bugs, suggesting new features, or just playing around with the code, we’d love to have your contributions.

## 🤝 Contributing
